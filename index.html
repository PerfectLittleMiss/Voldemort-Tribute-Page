					<h6>Biography:</h6>
					&emsp;Tom Marvolo Riddle was born in a London orphanage on December 31, 1926. His parents were Merope Gaunt, a witch, and Tom Riddle Sr, a muggle. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was placed in Slytherin house. He was one of few Parselmouths in wizarding history and opened the Chamber of Secrets while he was in school, resulting in the death of a classmate and the expulsion of another.
					<br>
					&emsp;After graduating from Hogwarts, Riddle worked as an apprentice at Borgin and Burkes. Not long after leaving Hogwarts Tom Riddle also shed his name donning the well known and feared name of Lord Voldemort. After leaving Borgin and Burkes, Riddle disappeared and not much is known about his whereabouts for some time. 
					<br>
					&emsp;Later, he would resurface as Lord Voldemort with a following of Death Eaters as he attempted to take over the wizarding world. This first attempt came to an end after many casualties when he tried to kill Harry Potter.
					<br>
					&emsp;Voldemort disappeared for 11 years before reappearing while trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone. He was once again thwarted by Harry Potter and he disappeared for a few years only to be fully returned to power 3 years later. After his resurrection, Voldemort began to rebuild his army and 2 years later overthrew the Ministry of Magic began a new reign of terror. However, not even an entire year later his reign of terror would come to an end at the Battle of Hogwarts where he was once again defeated by Harry Potter, this time for good.
